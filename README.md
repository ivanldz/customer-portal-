## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

This project represents a simplification of a solution I developed in my professional environment. It's a system aimed at facilitating communication between a service provider and its clients, enabling the latter to submit complaints on various topics. The API features a robust authentication system with different roles, as well as functionalities for email sending and database management.
